console.log(
  `The user with name : ${usr.firstName} has the address : ${usrDetails.address} and the email of : ${usrDetails.email}`

// The catch with backticks is that it automatically stringifies the entities. so if you wanted to console log the array object you won't be able to with backticks. you'll only
// get the stringified form of the same. This is fine for arrays with primitive types since you'll be able to see the values. But for an object.. it's only going to print [object]
// So you have to be a little wary of how you end up using this

// Destructure operator

// Allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array

// the last parameter can be prefixed with ...
// remaining arguments to the function are placed within a "standard" JS array

console.log(justApple);
console.log(restEdibles);

// this can be done on objects as well, instead of the square braces we use the curly braces.
